<h2 id="first">First day in KBTU</h2>
<p>The first day at <strong>KBTU</strong> was both exciting and overwhelming. The campus buzzed with energy as students gathered for orientation. I met new people, explored the facilities, and received an introduction to university life. It was a mix of nervousness and curiosity, but overall, it felt like the start of a great journey.</p>



<h2 id="second">Meeting new friends</h2>
<p>Meeting <em>"new"</em> friends was exciting. I found new people that are willing to help to the freshman and trying all the best to make me feel comfortable in this wonderful uni KBTU.</p>
